# Circuit Analysis
Three different circuits data will be analyze. For each circuit # there is a practica# folder containing an ```analysis.py``` program that will read the data stored in a .txt file.
The plots and results will be saved in your current working directory.


## Circuit 1: RTD sensor response. 
Data read from [data_1.txt](https://github.com/AliMRamos/sensores/blob/master/practica1/data_1.txt)
## Circuit 2: NTC sensor response
Data read from [data_2.txt](https://github.com/AliMRamos/sensores/blob/master/practica2/data_2.txt)

## Circuit 3: thermocouple type J response
Data read from [data_1.txt](https://github.com/AliMRamos/sensores/blob/master/practica3/data_3.txt)
